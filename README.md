# Palindrome Checker

Palindrome Checker is a web-based application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to check if a text is a palindrome automatically **without** the need to press any buttons.

## Features

- **Automatic Palindrome Check**: Users simply enter text into the input, and the result will be displayed directly below the input.
- **No Check Button**: No need to click the button to check the palindrome.
- **Responsive Interface**: Designed to be used comfortably on a variety of devices, both desktop and mobile.
- **Attractive Display**: Developed with CSS to provide a clean and modern user experience.

## How it works

1. **Text Defining Update**: JavaScript handles text checking automatically every time a user types.
2. **Palindrome Validation**: The app checks that the entered text is the same when read from the front and back.
3. **Responsive Design**: CSS ensures the UI stays optimal across different screen sizes.
